# Microprocessor-Systems-Project
A student designed 3D space scanner. This device is an embedded spatial measurement system that gathers data from any given space using a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and a stepper motor to provide a 360-degree measurement of distance within a single vertical geometric plane. The data is then analyzed using a PC application and graphically mapped and displayed.
